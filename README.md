I have implemented infix to postfix conversion algorithm in this project

All the Arithmetic Operation like (+ * - / % ) are calculated using below mentioned two steps:

steps  :-
1)converting users input (infix expression) into postfix expression using STACK Data Structure.
eg).  (infix)  4+5-2     ===45+2- (postfix)

2)Evaluating Postfix expression for getting desired result:

#End
